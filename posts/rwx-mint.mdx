## Why Visivo Uses RWX Mint for CI/CD

At Visivo, we're always looking for new tools that streamline our development workflow, reduce friction, and improve efficiency. When it came to optimizing our CI/CD pipeline, RWX Mint was a natural fit. Having implemented it at multiple companies before, I knew it could deliver significant improvements over traditional CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions.

### The Power of RWX Mint

Mint is a DAG-based job runner for CI/CD, similar to GitHub Actions but with several key advantages. After adopting it for Visivo, we saw immediate benefits.

#### **10x Faster CI/CD Runtimes**

Mint's DAG-based job runner allows us to parallelize tasks efficiently. This means that instead of running steps sequentially, dependencies are mapped out and executed in parallel wherever possible. As a result, our CI/CD pipelines are now **10x faster** than they were before.

#### **Intelligent Caching Saves Time**

One of the most frustrating aspects of CI/CD is waiting for repetitive tasks to execute over and over. Mint's intelligent caching mechanism speeds up builds by skipping unnecessary work. By caching workflow tasks, we've significantly cut down redundant processing time, making our deployments faster and smoother.

#### **A Modern UI with Better Error Handling**

While GitHub Actions provides logs, debugging failures can be tedious. Mint's modern UI makes error reporting **far more intuitive**, surfacing issues clearly without needing to sift through walls of text. This has made troubleshooting CI/CD failures much less painful.

#### **Remote Debugging for Faster Development**

One of Mint's standout features is **remote debugging** ([docs](https://www.rwx.com/docs/mint/remote-debugging)). Developing CI/CD scripts can be a slow feedback loopâ€”commit, push, wait, debug. Mint eliminates this pain point by allowing **real-time debugging** of workflows remotely. This has been a game-changer for our team, dramatically reducing iteration time on new automation.

#### **Excellent Support and Migration Assistance**

RWX's team has been **incredibly responsive** whenever we had migration questions. Their quick turnaround times and hands-on support made the transition smooth, which is not something we've experienced with other CI/CD providers.

## RWX's Take on Visivo

RWX published [a blog post](https://www.rwx.com/blog/visivo-analytics) about how Visivo integrates with Mint. we're excited about continuing to refine our deployment processes with their platform.

For those interested in exploring Mint further, check out their [documentation](https://www.rwx.com/docs/mint). If you're building a modern data tool like Visivo, it's well worth considering for CI/CD.
