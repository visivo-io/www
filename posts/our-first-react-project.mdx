A detailed overview of our first project using React. This project marked an important transition in our development stack and helped us establish better practices for front-end development.

We chose React for its robust ecosystem, excellent developer experience, and strong community support. Throughout the project, we learned valuable lessons about component architecture, state management, and performance optimization.
