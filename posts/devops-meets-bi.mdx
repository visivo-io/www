# DevOps Meets BI: Visivo’s Local Development and AI-Powered Builder [Pre-release]

#### How Visivo brings software development best practices (and even AI assistance) into the world of business intelligence, enabling faster, more reliable dashboard development.

## Introduction

Business intelligence is undergoing a transformation. The traditional model — manual dashboard tweaks in a GUI, isolated from the software development lifecycle — is giving way to a new paradigm: **Analytics as code**. Visivo is at the forefront of this change, marrying the principles of DevOps with BI. By treating dashboards as code, Visivo allows data teams to apply the same rigor and agility of modern software development to analytics. And it doesn’t stop there. Visivo is also pioneering the use of AI to accelerate BI development, making it easier than ever to go from question to insight.

In this article, we’ll explore how Visivo enables a true DevOps workflow for BI, from local development to CI/CD deployments. We’ll then dive into the exciting possibilities of Visivo’s **AI Builder**, an emerging feature that uses artificial intelligence to assist in creating and refining dashboards. Whether you’re a data engineer, analyst, or a stakeholder interested in the process behind the dashboards, you’ll see how Visivo is redefining how analytics projects are built and maintained.

## Local Development: Dashboards in Your IDE

One of the pillars of DevOps is the idea that development should be done in an environment that’s isolated, reproducible, and friendly to iteration. Visivo embraces this by allowing you to develop your entire BI project locally, using the tools you love:

* **Code Editor Integration:** Your Visivo project (YAML files, SQL models, etc.) can be opened in any code editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.). Visivo even provides a VS Code extension with linting and auto-complete for its YAML syntax. This means as you type configuration, you get instant feedback and suggestions, speeding up development and reducing errors.
* **Version Control:** Since everything is plain text (configuration files, SQL, Python scripts if any), you put your Visivo project in Git (or any VCS). This is transformative — every change to a dashboard is tracked. You can create branches for new features or bug fixes, peer review changes via pull requests, and maintain a history of how your analytics evolved. No more mysterious changes or “dashboard final\_v2” files; it’s all documented.
* **Local Data Sources:** During development, you might not want to hit production databases. Visivo lets you configure local or sample data sources in your profile for testing. You can, for example, point to a local SQLite database with anonymized data while building, then switch to Snowflake in production.
* **Isolated Environment:** Use virtual environments or containers to encapsulate the Visivo runtime. This ensures that the environment in which you develop can be the same as the one in CI or production. If it works on your machine in that container, it will work on the server — eliminating the “it works on my machine” problem.

The local development workflow looks like this: You pull the latest code from git, make changes to the Visivo config or models using your IDE (with guidance from linting), run `visivo serve` to see the results in real time, run tests (`visivo test` or as part of serve) to verify quality, and iterate. When satisfied, you commit and push your changes.

By developing locally with proper tooling, building a Visivo dashboard feels like building a software application. This is a huge leap from the clicky, manual setup of traditional BI dashboards, and it enables everything that comes next.

## CI/CD for Dashboards

Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) are cornerstones of DevOps. They ensure that changes are automatically tested and deployed in a consistent manner. Visivo was designed to fit into CI/CD pipelines naturally:

* **Continuous Integration:** You can set up a CI pipeline (using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI, or RWX Mint as we use internally) that triggers on every push or pull request. This pipeline can install Visivo in a fresh environment, build the project, and run all tests (as described in our quality article). Because Visivo can run headless (no manual steps needed), the CI can validate that the dashboard builds successfully and meets all quality checks. If something fails (e.g., a test or a broken reference), the CI pipeline fails, and the team is notified to fix it. This automated check acts as a safety net.
* **Review and Collaboration:** In a pull request, colleagues can see not only the code changes but also the CI results. They might even preview the dashboard changes if you publish artifacts or use a feature branch deployment. This brings a collaborative, engineering-oriented process to BI development — far different from one person making a change directly in a BI tool with no oversight.
* **Continuous Deployment:** Once changes are merged to main, you can have CD jobs that deploy the updated Visivo project to various environments. For example, automatically deploy to a staging environment where power users can give final sign-off, then deploy to production. Deployments are as simple as running `visivo deploy` with the appropriate settings or pushing the static build if using that approach.
* **Mirroring Your Software Workflow:** If your organization already has a DevOps workflow for software, Visivo can plug right in. It mirrors the idea of having development, staging, and production environments, automated tests, and one-click deployments. Visivo projects can live alongside application code in a mono-repo or in their own repo, whichever fits your workflow. The key is that analytics deliverables (dashboards) are now part of the codebase, not an afterthought.
* **Rollback Capabilities:** Because each deployment is tied to a git commit (you deploy a specific version of the Visivo project), rolling back is as easy as redeploying a previous commit if an issue is found. This is far more controlled than trying to undo changes in a BI tool manually. It also aligns with the principle of **incremental, reversible changes** in DevOps.

We’ve experienced the benefits of this firsthand. In a recent improvement, we integrated RWX Mint (a DAG-based CI/CD runner) and saw 10x faster pipeline runs for our Visivo projects, as we detailed in [our blog post on CI/CD](/blog/rwx-mint). Faster pipelines mean we get feedback on our Visivo changes quickly, enabling rapid iteration while still guarding quality.

## Infrastructure as Code for BI

Another aspect of bringing DevOps to BI is treating the deployment infrastructure as code. With Visivo, your **infrastructure needs for BI are minimal and declarative**:

* **Deployment Config as Code:** In Visivo’s config, you specify your deployment target and any resource configuration (like whether to use Visivo Cloud or generate a static site). There’s also a `profiles.yml` for connection info. These can be parameterized or configured via environment variables, meaning your CI can inject production secrets at deploy time without them living in code.
* **Scaling and Performance:** If self-hosting, your static output can be served on scalable infrastructure (like behind a CDN). If using Visivo Cloud, the scaling is handled for you. The point is, you define what you need and it’s deployed repeatably. No manual server tweaking specifically for the BI tool.
* **Monitoring Deployment:** You can integrate logs from Visivo builds or use tools to monitor uptime of the published dashboards as you would any web service. Because a Visivo dashboard is essentially a web app, existing monitoring and logging practices apply.

All these mean your analytics stack becomes part of the unified tech stack, managed with the same discipline as your core applications. This is a big win for reliability and for breaking down silos between data teams and engineering teams.

## Enter the AI Builder: AI-Assisted Dashboard Development

So far, we’ve discussed how Visivo applies tried-and-true DevOps practices to BI. Now let’s look at something more cutting-edge, the incorporation of AI into the development process.

Visivo’s **AI Builder** is an emerging capability that leverages artificial intelligence (think GPT-style large language models) to assist in creating and refining dashboards. The idea is simple but powerful: *what if an AI agent could help you write your Visivo config or suggest improvements based on best practices?*

Here’s what the AI Builder can do (or is aiming to do):

* **Natural Language to Dashboard Components:** Imagine telling the AI, *“I need a bar chart of total sales by region over the last quarter.”* The AI Builder could generate the necessary YAML snippet: the model (SQL query for sales by region), the trace (bar chart with region on x and sales on y), and the chart layout. It might even suggest adding a selector for switching to a different time range. This jumpstarts development, handling boilerplate and letting you refine specifics.
* **Insightful Suggestions:** The AI, having seen many dashboards, might suggest, *“Your chart has a lot of data points, consider using a log scale,”* or *“You can improve clarity by sorting the bars in descending order. Shall I apply that?”* It’s like having an expert advisor pair-programming with you on analytics.
* **Automation of Repetitive Tasks:** Need to create 10 similar charts for 10 different metrics? The AI can loop through and generate those quickly, following the pattern you demonstrate. It could also write tests for each metric by copying a template and adjusting the field names.
* **Interpreting Errors and Logs:** If a Visivo build fails or a test fails, the AI Builder could analyze the error and immediately point out the likely cause, even fixing a small typo in a SQL query or suggesting what data might be missing. This reduces debug time.
* **Assisting Non-Coders:** For less technical users who know what they want but not how to write YAML or SQL, the AI Builder can serve as an interface. They describe their needs in plain language, and the AI produces a draft dashboard. A developer can then review the generated code (since it’s all visible) before deploying. This bridges the gap between stakeholders and the code-based system, making Visivo more accessible without sacrificing the benefits of code.

All of this is possible because Visivo’s configurations are standardized and structured, which is an environment where AI can be very effective. It’s much easier for AI to generate a YAML and SQL for a chart than to directly manipulate a visual GUI reliably.

The AI Builder is like having a junior data engineer on the team who works at superhuman speed and has read every documentation page. It won’t replace the critical thinking and context-specific decisions of your analytics experts, but it can handle the grunt work and even spark ideas that you might not have considered.

## How AI Builder Fits into the Workflow

Integrating an AI assistant into a DevOps workflow might sound tricky, but here’s how it can work smoothly with Visivo:

* **In your IDE:** The AI Builder could be available as a command or extension in VS Code. Highlight a section and ask the AI to explain or complete it. Or open a chat panel to request a new component. This keeps you in control, you review and edit AI contributions just like you would review a teammate’s pull request.
* **As a Chatbot in the Web App:** Perhaps Visivo’s web interface (or docs site) provides a chatbot where you can ask “How do I add a rolling average to my chart?” and it gives you code examples. This lowers the learning curve and also speeds up skilled users.
* **Code Generation with Guardrails:** AI suggestions can come with references to documentation (like “I set `type: bar` based on Visivo docs”). This helps you trust but verify the AI’s output. Ultimately, since everything is code, you run it through the same CI/tests. If the AI made a mistake, your tests will catch it, and you can refine. Over time, the AI also learns from these corrections.
* **Continuous Learning:** The more you use the AI Builder, the more it can learn your project’s context (the schema of your data, your naming conventions, etc.). It might start to auto-suggest consistent names or recall that “total\_sales” is the field you use for revenue in various models. This project-specific learning makes it even more effective as you scale.

We envision scenarios where a small team, empowered by the AI Builder, can build out a complex analytics platform in a fraction of the time it used to take. The heavy lifting of writing repetitive config or figuring out syntax is handled, letting the team focus on logic and interpretation.

## Benefits of Marrying DevOps and AI in Visivo

By now, it’s clear that Visivo isn’t just a static tool, it’s a platform that grows with modern development practices. The combination of DevOps and AI yields several compelling benefits:

* **Faster Development Cycles:** DevOps automation + AI assistance = idea to production in record time. You reduce human error and hand-offs, and you iterate quickly based on immediate feedback.
* **Higher Quality Outputs:** Automated tests and CI catch mistakes, and AI suggestions (plus linting) reduce the chance of misconfigurations. Even junior team members can contribute confidently with these safety nets.
* **Empowered Teams:** Data analysts become more like software developers in their workflow, which empowers them to take ownership of the analytics product. At the same time, business users can be more involved (via natural language requests to the AI). This fosters a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement.
* **Scalability:** As your organization’s data needs grow, you can handle more dashboards and changes without proportional increases in manual effort. The pipeline and bots handle a lot of the scaling, so the team can maintain a lean operation.
* **Innovative Solutions:** With AI in the mix, you might discover new ways to visualize or analyze data that you hadn’t thought of. The AI might introduce a novel chart type or calculation based on patterns it knows, sparking innovation.

## Conclusion

Visivo is leading the charge in bringing DevOps principles and AI power into the realm of business intelligence. The phrase “DevOps for dashboards” is no longer an oxymoron — it’s the reality that Visivo delivers. By treating dashboards as code, enabling local development, integrating with CI/CD, and soon by providing AI-assisted building, Visivo dramatically accelerates the BI development lifecycle.

To recap:

In essence, Visivo is not just a tool to make pretty charts — it’s a framework to **engineer** your analytics, with all the benefits that modern engineering entails. Whether you’re adopting Visivo to replace a legacy BI system or starting fresh, you’re also adopting a forward-looking approach that will pay dividends in speed, trust, and capability.

As you embark on this journey, don’t forget to utilize all aspects of the platform. If you enjoyed how AI can speed up coding, also consider how Visivo’s testing and lineage (from our other posts) will give you confidence in the output. The convergence of these features is where the magic truly happens. A dashboard built with Visivo can be trusted not only because it was tested (quality), but also because it was built in a controlled, collaborative way (DevOps), and perhaps even because it was optimized with some AI inspiration.

The future of BI is here: it’s agile, it’s automated, and it’s intelligent. With Visivo, you’re not just keeping up with the future — you’re helping create it.
