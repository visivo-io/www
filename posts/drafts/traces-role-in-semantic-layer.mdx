# Why Traces Are the Missing Link in the Semantic Layer

## What is the Semantic Layer?

The semantic layer is a concept in data warehousing that allows users to query data in a more intuitive and user-friendly way. It is a layer of abstraction that sits between the raw data in the data warehouse and the users who need to access it.

## What is the Trace?

A trace is a record of a user's interaction with a data source. It is a record of the user's query, the data that was returned, and the user's response to the data.
